Tool to automatically parse tags from Google calendar invite responses and aggregate hours for timesheets, because I HATE TIMESHEETS!

- You will need to have set up a Google Cloud project with the Calendar API enabled.
- You will need to have generated the credentials.json to allow the script to access your Google calendar.
- Put tags in notes in your invite responses. The tool will aggregate the hours of all such tags, for now.
- Work to show per-day breakdown per code is ongoing.

Work to suitably format for timesheet entry is ongoing.
