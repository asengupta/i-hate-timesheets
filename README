Tool to automatically parse tags from Google calendar invite responses and aggregate hours for timesheets, because I HATE TIMESHEETS!

- Put tags in notes in your invite responses. The tool will aggregate the hours of all such tags, for now.
- Work to show per-day breakdown per code is ongoing.

Work to suitably format for timesheet entry is ongoing.
